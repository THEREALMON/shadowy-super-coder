While crypto skeptics make criticisms, we want to give tributes to all Shadowy Super-Coder out there who contributed to
the blockchain ecosystem!


### Result Summary
This repo contains queries run on [ethereum public dataset on google bigquery](https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/dataset/bigquery-public-data:crypto_ethereum)
which are used for the NFT and perks drop. Here are the rules and result:

1. Deployed at least 1 contract on Ethereum mainnet before _August 1st, 2021_.
2. Deployed contracts that had at least 2 different non-deployer addresses interacted.

These addresses are ranked in two tiers:
1. Tier 1 **7,466 Shadowy Super-Coders**: those that served >=500 unique addresses & contracts had at least 1 transaction in 2021.
2. Tier 2 **102,828 Shadowy Coders**: those that served less <500 unique addresses or those that served >=500 but have no active transaction since 2021.

Special shout out to our Super-Coder friend @banteg who helped curate data.
